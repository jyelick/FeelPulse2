**Prompt Title:** *HRV + Mood Tracker App with Apple Health Integration*

**Description:**

Create a mobile app that monitors Heart Rate Variability (HRV) over a 5-day rolling window using data from Apple HealthKit. The app will track stress accumulation based on HRV trends and prompt users to focus on self-care when needed. Users can also log their mood daily using a smiley face scale, and future integrations will allow importing mood data from popular tracking apps.

**Core Features:**

1. **Apple Health HRV Integration:**

   * Automatically import daily HRV data from Apple HealthKit with user permission.
   * Display HRV values on a 5-day rolling graph.
   * Sync with Apple HealthKit regularly to ensure up-to-date data.

2. **Stress Detection & Self-Care Prompts:**

   * Analyze HRV trends to detect signs of accumulated stress (e.g., sustained decrease or irregular patterns).
   * Display non-judgmental, supportive messages like:
     **"Your stress levels appear to be accumulating. Consider prioritizing self-care and stress-relieving activities over the next few days."**

3. **Mood Tracking (Smiley Face UI):**

   * Include a simple daily check-in using 5 emoji-style smiley faces (ranging from very sad to very happy).
   * Visualize mood trends alongside HRV data for easy pattern recognition.

4. **Future-Ready Mood App Integration:**

   * Prepare the app architecture to support importing mood data from apps like Daylio, Bearable, and eMoods via CSV/JSON/API.
   * Mock this feature in the MVP version to show proof of concept.

**Stretch Features (Optional):**

* Streak tracking for daily mood check-ins.
* Export data (CSV/JSON) for personal review or sharing with a clinician.
* Simple onboarding explaining HRV and how to use the app.

**Tech Stack:**

* **Platform:** iOS (Apple HealthKit required)
* **Frontend:** React Native (with Expo or bare workflow)
* **HealthKit Integration:** `react-native-health` or `expo-health`
* **Graphing Library:** Victory Native, Recharts, or similar
